The PixSim API allows for real-time synchronization of Pixel Simulators for things like real-time strategy games, co-op puzzles, and more.

The concept of synchronizing two games with very different engines is a challenge, as the game mechanics are different and pixel IDs differ wildly. The PixSim API aims to do exactly this, making it possible to play a multiplayer game with someone with on a different client altogether.

***

Documentation for the API itself is yet to be made, as the PixSim API is still under development and is not complete. (Hopefully somebody remembers to update this)

## PixSimAssembly

PixSimAssembly is an assembly-like language but with JavaScript-like expressions, variables, and arrays. It too is under active development. If you have suggestions, post them on the [Pixel Simulator Discord](https://discord.pixelsimulator.repl.co/)

This repository contains code for not only multiplayer (over a websocket through `/pixsim-api/` path) but also the accounts system.
